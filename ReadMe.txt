This is a school project inteded to vizualized relationships about the diffrent variables associted with 311 calls in buffalo,ny. This is the project discription: 


There is also a first project to work on, based on the 311 service request data from Open data buffalo.   Most of the variables are categorical in nature,  the categories of major interest are probably

-Status, subject, reason, type, object type, council district, police district, neighborhood

-There is also a couple of date variables

It looks like status, subject, reason, type and object type might be interesting categorical variables.   Which of these can be described by a limited number of categories?  Which are not described easily as a limited number of outcomes

Figure out which of the outcomes fit into a limited number of categories, and then produce some graphs explaining how they are related to council district, police district, neighborhood.

Do different districts and/or neighborhoods tend to different numbers of 311 calls?

Do different months have different number of 311 reports?  What about different years?
